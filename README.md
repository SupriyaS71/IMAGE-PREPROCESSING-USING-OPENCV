# IMAGE-PREPROCESSING-USING-OPENCV
Image preprocessing using OpenCV involves techniques like resizing, grayscale conversion, noise reduction, and histogram equalization to enhance image quality. These processes help prepare images for analysis by improving features such as clarity, contrast, and consistency, making them suitable for tasks like object detection and segmentation.
